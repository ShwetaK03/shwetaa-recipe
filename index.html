<p>Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian 
    breakfast of crispy crepes made with fermented rice and lentil batter.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular rice</li>
        <li>Whole urad dal</li>
        <li>Chana  dal</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take all the ingredients to prepare the dosa batter.
         Rice, urad dal and fenugreek seeds are the main ingredients.
          Chana dal is used for getting a golden color for Dosa.</li>
          <li>Rinse both types of rice (regular rice and parboiled rice) together in water for 3-4 times
            and soak them in 2 cups of water for 4-5 hours â€“ (Place both types of rice in a medium-size
            bowl and fill it with water till 3/4th height. Rinse the rice by rubbing them between your fingertips; 
            the water will turn cloudy. Drain the water and repeat the process 3-4 times).
        </li>
        <li>Rinse urad dal and chana dal together in water, add fenugreek seeds 
            and soak in 1 cup water for 4-5 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Drain water from urad dal in a small bowl and reserve it (it will be used in the next step while grinding the dal).
             Add drained urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds mixture in the medium jar of a mixer grinder or blender.</li>
        <li>Add salt and mix both batters well using spoon. The final batter should not be too thick or too watery.
             Cover it with plate and leave it at room temperature for 8-10 hours or overnight for fermentation.
             During cold weather, keep the batter in warm place (or inside the oven with oven light on) for fermentation.</li>
             <li>Heat non-stick tava or iron tava (skillet or griddle) over medium flame. Sprinkle few drops of water on the surface.
                  If water drops sizzle and evaporate within few seconds, tava is hot enough to cook. Apply 1/2-teaspoon oil on the
                  griddle and spread it evenly with a spatula or a clean wet cloth. Take a ladle full of batter, pour it over the surface of tawa, </li>
                  <li>Flip it and cook for a minute. If you are making thin dosa (as shown in the photo), you do not need to cook the other side.
                       Transfer it to a plate. Wipe tava with clean wet cloth before making next dosa 
                       (this is to prevent dosa from sticking to Pan) and repeat the process for remaining batter.
                       <strong>Hot and crispy plain dosa is ready.</strong> 
                </li>
